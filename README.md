# Pang Mobile

A demo Pang clone developed in Unity for the Mobile Programming course for the Master in Computer Game Development at UNIVR. The game recreates the key elements of Pang, where you must pop bouncing balls that split into smaller ones, all while avoiding getting hit.

You can [**PLAY**](https://chri-sp.itch.io/pang-mobile) the web version on itch.io.
